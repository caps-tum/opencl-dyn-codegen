<p>
This panel shows the GPU performance counters for a profile session. To get the .csv file of the result, browse to the location of the file shown in the title of the panel. To quickly navigate to the location of the file, right click the session in the <a class="el" href="clsessionexplorerpage.html">Session Explorer</a>, and select "Open Containing Folder" from the menu. See <a class="el" href="cltimelinefiles.html">Description of Output Files</a> for a detailed description of the format of this file.<p>
On the top of the panel, there is a button to launch the profiling result with an external application (if Microsoft Excel is bound to the .csv file extension, then clicking on the button will launch Excel). There are also three checkboxes to select the view options for the session result.<ul>
<li><b>Show Kernel Dispatch</b>: If this option is selected, then the session result will show the kernel dispatch operations.<br>
</li><li><b>Show Data Transfer</b>: If this option is selected, then the session result will show the data transfer operations.<br>
</li><li><b>Show Zero Column</b>: If this option is selected, then the session result will show all columns (even for columns with zero/empty values).<br>
</li></ul>
<p>
The first several columns in the session are always displayed even if no performance counters are selected for the profile. A description of these columns for OpenCL&trade; applications is given in the table below:<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td><b>Name</b> </td><td><b>Description</b>  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Method </td><td>The kernel name (appended by __k[KernelID]_[DeviceName][DeviceID] to differentiate unique kernels with the same name).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ExecutionOrder </td><td>The order of execution for the kernel dispatch operations in the program.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ThreadID </td><td>The thread ID of the host thread that made the OpenCL API call that initiated the kernel dispatch operation.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>CallIndex </td><td>The call index of the OpenCL&trade; API call that initiated the kernel dispatch operation.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>GlobalWorkSize </td><td>The global work-item size of the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>WorkGroupSize </td><td>The work-group size of the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Time </td><td>The time spent executing the kernel in milliseconds (does not include the kernel setup time).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>LocalMemSize </td><td>The amount of local memory (LDS for GPU) in bytes being used by the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>VGPRs </td><td>The number of general purpose vector registers used by the kernel (valid only for GPU devices).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>SGPRs </td><td>The number of general purpose scalar registers used by the kernel (valid only for AMD Radeon HD 7000 series GPU devices based on Graphics Core Next Architecture/Southern Islands or newer).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ScratchRegs </td><td>The number of scratch registers used by the kernel (valid only for GPU devices). If non zero, this is typically the main bottleneck. To reduce this number, reduce the number of GPRs used by the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>FCStacks </td><td>The size of the flow control stack used by the kernel (valid only for AMD Radeon HD 6000 series GPU devices or older). This number may affect the number of wavefronts in-flight. To reduce the stack size, reduce the amount of flow control nesting in the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>KernelOccupancy </td><td>The kernel occupancy (valid only for GPU devices). This is an estimate of the number of in-flight wavefronts on a compute unit as a percentage of the theoretical maximum number of wavefronts that the compute unit can support.  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A description of these columns for a DirectCompute application is given in the table below:<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td><b>Name</b> </td><td><b>Description</b>  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Identifier </td><td>The kernel name (appended by a pointer value that is unique for each kernel instance) or the data transfer operation name.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ExecutionOrder </td><td>The order of execution for the kernel and data transfer operations from the program.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ThreadGroup </td><td>The Thread Group size of the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>WorkGroupSize </td><td>The work-group size of the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Time </td><td>For a kernel dispatch operation: time spent executing the kernel in milliseconds (does not include the kernel setup time). For a data transfer operation, time spent transferring data in milliseconds.   </td></tr>
</table>

The <a class="el" href="settingscounterselection.html">Counter Selection page</a> of the <a class="el" href="clsettingspage.html">APP Profiler Settings Window </a> contains the description of the performance counters. This description is also shown if you hover the mouse cursor over the counter name in the Session panel.<p>
To show the source, IL or ISA code of an OpenCL&trade; kernel or the DXASM code of a DirectCompute kernel, click on the kernel name in the first column to open the <a class="el" href="clcodeviewerpage.html">Code Viewer Panel </a>.<p>
For OpenCL&trade; applications, if a kernel is run on a CPU device, only the global work size, work group size, local memory, and the execution time for the kernel will be available.<p>
Using the performance counters, you can:<ul>
<li>Find the number of resources (General Purpose Registers, Local Memory size, and Flow Control Stack size) allocated for the kernel. These resources affect the possible number of in-flight wavefronts in the GPU. A higher number better hides data latency.</li><li>Determine the number of ALU, global and local memory instructions executed by the GPU.</li><li>Determine the number of bytes fetched from and written to the global memory.</li><li>Determine the utilization of the SIMD engines and memory units in the system.</li><li>View the efficiency of the Shader Compiler in packing ALU instructions into the VLIW instructions used by AMD GPUs.</li><li>View any local memory (Local Data Share - LDS) bank conflicts.</li><li>View <a class="el" href="clkerneloccupancydescriptionpage.html">Kernel occupancy percentage </a>, which estimates the number of in-flight wavefronts on a compute unit as a percentage of the theoretical maximum number of wavefronts that the compute unit can support.</li></ul>
<p>
To view more information about the <a class="el" href="clkerneloccupancydescriptionpage.html">kernel occupancy </a> figure for an OpenCL&trade; kernel, click on the percentage value in the <b>Kernel Occupancy</b> column to open the <a class="el" href="clkerneloccupancyviewerpage.html">Kernel Occupancy Viewer Panel </a>. </div>
