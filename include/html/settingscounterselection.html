Below is a list of available counters and a brief description of them. The exact counters shown depends on the type of GPU installed on the system.<p>
The supported counters on AMD Radeon&trade; HD 6000 series graphics cards or older:<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td><b>Name</b> </td><td><b>Description</b>  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Wavefronts </td><td>The total number of wavefronts  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ALUInsts </td><td>The average number of ALU instructions executed per work-item (affected by flow control).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>FetchInsts </td><td>The average number of Fetch instructions from the video memory executed per work-item (affected by flow control).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>WriteInsts </td><td>The average number of Write instructions to the video memory executed per work-item (affected by flow control).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ALUBusy </td><td>The percentage of GPUTime ALU instructions are processed. Value range: 0% (bad) to 100% (optimal).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ALUFetchRatio </td><td>The ratio of ALU to Fetch instructions. If the number of Fetch instructions is zero, then one will be used instead.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ALUPacking </td><td>The ALU vector packing efficiency (in percentage). This value indicates how well the Shader Compiler packs the scalar or vector ALU in your kernel to the 5-way VLIW instructions. Value range: 0% (bad) to 100% (optimal). Values below 70 percent indicate that ALU dependency chains may be preventing full utilization of the processor.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>FetchSize </td><td>The total kilobytes fetched from the video memory. This is measured with all extra fetches and any cache or memory effects taken into account.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>CacheHit </td><td>The percentage of fetches that hit the data cache. Value range: 0% (no hit) to 100% (optimal).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>FetchUnitBusy </td><td>The percentage of GPUTime the Fetch unit is active. The result includes the stall time (FetchUnitStalled). This is measured with all extra fetches and any cache or memory effects taken into account. Value range: 0% to 100% (fetch-bound).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>FetchUnitStalled </td><td>The percentage of GPUTime the Fetch unit is stalled. Try reducing the number of fetches or reducing the amount per fetch if possible. Value range: 0% (optimal) to 100% (bad).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>WriteUnitStalled </td><td>The percentage of GPUTime Write unit is stalled. Value range: 0% to 100% (bad).  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Additional performance counters for AMD Radeon&trade; HD 5000 or for AMD Radeon&trade; HD 6000 series graphics cards:<p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td><b>Name</b> </td><td><b>Description</b>  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>FastPath </td><td>The total kilobytes written to the video memory through the FastPath which only supports basic operations: no atomics or sub-32 bit types. This is an optimized path in the hardware.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>CompletePath </td><td>The total kilobytes written to the video memory through the CompletePath which supports atomics and sub-32 bit types (byte, short). This number includes bytes for load, store and atomics operations on the buffer. This number may indicate a big performance impact (higher number equals lower performance). If possible, remove the usage of this Path by moving atomics to the local memory or partition the kernel.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>PathUtilization </td><td>The percentage of bytes written through the FastPath or CompletePath compared to the total number of bytes transferred over the bus. To increase the path utilization, use the FastPath. Value range: 0% (bad) to 100% (optimal).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>LDSFetchInsts </td><td>The average number of Fetch instructions from the LDS executed per work-item (affected by flow control). This counter is a subset of the ALUInsts counter.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>LDSWriteInsts </td><td>The average number of Write instructions to the LDS executed per work-item (affected by flow control). This counter is a subset of the ALUInsts counter.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>LDSBankConflict </td><td>The percentage of GPUTime LDS is stalled by bank conflicts. Value range: 0% (optimal) to 100% (bad).  </td></tr>
