<h1 align="center">Release Notes for AMD APP Profiler</h1>

<p><a name="New"><h3>What's New</h3>
<UL>
	<LI>
<b>v2.5.1804 (April 16th 2012)</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Support for AMD APP SDK v2.7.
			<li> Support for OpenCL&trade; 1.2.
			<li> Support for collecting performance counters on APU devices.
			<li> Full support for profiling with AMD Radeon&trade; HD7000 series GPUs based on Graphics Core Next/Southern Islands:
			<ul>
				<li> Added support for kernel occupancy analysis.
				<li> Added support for collecting performance counters for DirectCompute (DirectX 11) applications.
				<li> Addition of SALUBusy counter.
				<li> Fixed value reported for VALUBusy counter.
				<li> The values reported for LDSFetchInsts and LDSWriteInsts counters were inaccurate on AMD Radeon&trade; HD7000 series GPUs; thus for those GPUs, those two counters have been replaced by a single LDSInsts counter.
				<li> Fixed display of kernel ISA.
			</ul>
			<li> Improved OpenCL&trade; analysis module:
			<ul>
			    <li> Added detection of deprecated OpenCL&trade; APIs.
			</ul>
			<li> Added support for showing source and destination location, as well as zero-copy status for memory transfers initiated using clEnqueueMapBuffer or clEnqueueMapImage.  This information is displayed in the API Trace view.</li>
			<li> Added support for Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio&reg; projects that use User-defined Macros in the project settings.</li>
			<li> Fixed the --workingdirectory (-w) command line switch (set current directory) on Linux.</li>
			<li> Fixed some problems with importing previously-generated profile results into Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio&reg;.</li>
			<li> Changed the default installation directory on Windows to <b>%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\AMD\AMD APP Profiler</b> to make it more consistent with other AMD tools (i.e gDEBugger and CodeAnalyst)</li>
		</ul>
		<b>v2.4.1297 (December 19th 2011)</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Support for AMD APP SDK v2.6.
			<li> Added a kernel occupancy analyzer, which calculates and displays a kernel occupancy number, which estimates the number of in-flight wavefronts on a compute unit as a percentage of the theoretical maximum number of wavefronts that the compute unit can support.
			<li> Added support for collecting symbol information when collecting an application trace, allowing navigation from the API Trace view to the source code that called an API.
			<li> Improved OpenCL&trade; analysis module:
			<ul>
			    <li> Added detection of non-optimized data transfer operations.
			    <li> Added detection of redundant synchronization operations.
			    <li> Improved detection of unnecessary blocking write operations.
			    <li> Improved analysis in multithreaded applications (fixed false positives).
			</ul>
			<li> Added support for specifying which OpenCL&trade; APIs will be traced.
			<li> Added ability to rename sessions in the Session Explorer Window.
			<li> Added ability to automatically delete profiler sessions when closing a Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio&reg; solution.
			<li> Added support for modifying the parameters used to initiate a profiler session.
			<li> Added support for multiple-GPU systems when collecting performance counters.
			<li> Improved the CLPerfMarkerAMD library.
			<li> Improved performance when using timeout mode.
			<li> In the session window, "GPRs" column has been renamed "VGPRs" (vector GPRs).
			<li> Fixed a problem with loading saved counters from a file.
			<li> Fixed a problem where the performance counter values for some kernel dispatch operations were reported as all zeros.
			<li> Fixed a problem with missing GPU timestamps in an application trace when enabling the "Write trace data periodically during program execution" option.
			<li> Removed Data Transfer data from the Session view for OpenCL&trade; applications.  It is recommended that you use the Application Trace view to get information on data transfers.
			<li> Preview: Support for profiling with AMD Radeon&trade; HD7000 series GPUs (requires AMD APP SDK v2.6 and an AMD Catalyst version that supports this hardware).
		</ul>
		<br>
		<b>v2.3.822 (July 12th 2011)</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Support for AMD APP SDK v2.5.
			<li> Added an OpenCL&trade; analysis module that analyzes the API Trace and provides feedback on how the OpenCL&trade; application can be improved:
			<ul>
			    <li> Detects resource leaks of OpenCL&trade; objects.
			    <li> Detects non-optimal global or local work group size.
			    <li> Detects unnecessary blocking write operations.
			    <li> Detects failed OpenCL&trade; API calls.
			</ul>
			<li> Support for marking sections of host code with performance markers that will be displayed in the timeline visualization (CLPerfMarkerAMD library).
			<li> Support for including a call index in the Session csv file, allowing a specific kernel dispatch to be matched with its entry in the API trace.
